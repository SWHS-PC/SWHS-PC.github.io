    <h1>
      <a href="javascript:show('start')">The Haunted House</a>
    </h1>
    <div id="start">
      <p>You're walking home from school one afternoon in January. It's
late afternoon because you stayed after school for coding club,
and it's already getting dark. As usual, your route takes you
past that creepy abandoned house on your street.</p>
      <p>You hunch your shoulders and start to hurry past, but suddenly
a child's voice calls out from inside, “Help! Help!”</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('chicken')">Ignore the voice and continue home.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('front_door')">Run up to the front door and go in.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('back_yard')">Walk around back.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="back_yard" style="display:none">
      <p>You walk through the overgrown yard to the back of the house,
hoping to learn something without actually going inside.
However, all you can see of the house are pealing paint and
darkened windows.</p>
      <p>No wiser, you continue around to the front of the house and
face the front door.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('chicken')">Chicken out and continue home.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('front_door')">Open the front door and go in.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="chicken" style="display:none">
      <p>Feeling guilty, you pretend not to hear anything and rush home.</p>
      <p>You make it home safe and sound, and you never hear what
happened in the house that night. But in moments of doubt, you
still hear that child's voice, and wonder if you might have
prevented some horrible crime.</p>
      <p>THE END</p>
    </div>
    <div id="front_door" style="display:none">
      <p>The front door creaks loudly as you open it, and dust falls
from the ceiling. You sneeze, stirring up more dust, then
venture inside. The only light is from the open door behind
you, but fortunately you have a small flashlight in your
pocket. You pull it out and turn it on.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="javascript:show('entry')">Next</a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="entry" style="display:none">
      <p>You're in a dark paneled entry way. Behind you is the front
door. To your right is an opening leading to what appears
to be a kitchen. Ahead is a large room, which your puny
flashlight does not illuminate.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('kitchen')">Go into the kitchen.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('main_room')">Continue ahead into the large room.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('kitty')">Call out.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="kitchen" style="display:none">
      <p>You find yourself in an old kitchen with a large cast-iron
stove and many cabinets. You quickly search the cabinets,
hoping to find something useful – a knife perhaps – but
they're empty of everything except cobwebs.</p>
      <p>Through a partially-open door in the back of the kitchen,
you can see stairs leading down. Perhaps they lead to a
cellar.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('cellar')">Go down the stairs.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('entry')">Return to the entry way.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="cellar" style="display:none">
      <p>Pushing your way through cobwebs, you walk down the stairs
into the dark cellar. At the bottom, your flashlight catches
something white ahead on the stone floor. As you continue
forward to investigate, the cobwebs around you stir with a
sudden breeze from behind. You hear the door at the top of
the stairs slam shut and a bolt slide ominously into place.</p>
      <p>Now you recognize the white object on the floor: a bone,
part of a small human skeleton. In a panic, you rush back
up the stairs to try the door, but it won't budge. You call
out, but the darkness seems to muffle your voice. Still you
cry desperately for help, continuing even as your flashlight
dims and goes out. You cry out through endless hours of
darkness, growing increasingly parched until your voice
emerges only as a croak. At last you cry no more.</p>
      <p>THE END</p>
    </div>
    <div id="kitty" style="display:none">
      <p>Mustering your courage, you call out loudly, “Hello! Does
someone need help?”</p>
      <p>There is no response at first, but then you hear a high,
wordless voice somewhere on your left. Aiming your flashlight
there, you see a small door, which you had overlooked before
because it blends into the dark panelling – a closet perhaps.</p>
      <p>Cautiously, you open the door, then laugh as a cat emerges,
meowing pitiably. It was only a cat you heard all along!
You let the cat outside and continue home, relieved to be
spared any further adventure.</p>
      <p>THE END</p>
    </div>
    <div id="main_room" style="display:none">
      <p>You're in what must once have been a very elegant room.
Ahead, a grand staircase leads upstairs. Just below the
stairs is a very large grandfather clock. Off to the
side is a grand piano.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('upstairs')">Go up the stairs.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('clock')">Inspect the grandfather clock.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('entry')">Return to the entry way.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="upstairs" style="display:none">
      <p>At the top of the stairs is a long hallway with doors on
either side. Heart pounding, you tiptoe down the hall,
peaking into each of the rooms. You see only rotting
bedroom furniture and thick dust, long undisturbed.</p>
      <p>No one can have been up here for ages, you decide. The
voice must have come from somewhere else, unless you
imagined it. You head back down the stairs to the large
room with the grandfather clock and the piano.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('clock')">Inspect the grandfather clock.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('entry')">Return to the entry way.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="clock" style="display:none">
      <p>You take a closer look at the grandfather clock. It's not
running, of course, but you notice something strange.
Unlike everything else in the room, the clock is free of
dust. Could it be concealing some clue?</p>
      <p>You open the glass door in the front of the clock. Driven
by some impulse you don't understand, you start the pendulum
swinging. Suddenly, the mechanism springs to life! The
weights begin descending, and the hands start moving
rapidly – backwards!</p>
      <p>A gust of wind makes the hairs on the back of your neck
stand on end. You look up, and a pale light draws you eyes
to the top of the stairs. There stands a small figure, a
child. This must be the child you heard from outside, for
now he calls out again, “Help me!” in a voice that seems to
come from a great distance. The hilt of a knife protrudes
from the child's chest, but there is no blood. Indeed the
child seems utterly pale and bloodless, and looking closer
you find you can see right through him.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_talk')">Try to talk to the child.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_run')">Run away.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="ghost_talk" style="display:none">
      <p>Supressing the tremor in your voice, you say to the child,
“Are you OK? Can I help you?”</p>
      <p>The ghostly child looks at you and walks slowly down the
stairs. You back away, trying to keep some distance. At
the bottom of the stairs, the child turns left and walks
towards the corner of the room to your right.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_follow')">Follow the child.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_run')">Run away.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="ghost_follow" style="display:none">
      <p>As you approach the child, he passes right through the
front wall of the room. Close inspection reveals a door,
cleverly concealed in the panelling. You've heard that
old houses sometimes have hidden side passages used by
servants. This must be one of those.</p>
      <p>You pull open the door and walk through a narrow passage,
emerging into the kitchen. You can see the child to your
left through an open door. He is on his way downstairs,
perhaps to a cellar. On your right is an opening that
leads to the front entrance.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_cellar')">Follow the child downstairs.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="javascript:show('ghost_run')">Run away.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="ghost_cellar" style="display:none">
      <p>You follow the child downstairs and find him in the
corner of the cellar looking down. At his feet is a small
human skeleton, a child's skeleton.</p>
      <p>“It's you, isn't it?” you say, “Someone killed you and
hid your body down here.”</p>
      <p>The child looks at you and nods. You promise to find out
what happened and make sure he's properly buried. The
child smiles for the first time and fades away. The room
suddenly feels warmer, and you find that you are no
longer scared.</p>
      <p>The next day, you report what you found to the police,
omitting any mention of ghosts. You learn that a child
lived in that house with his mother and stepfather many
years ago. Soon after the mother died, the stepfather
reported the child missing, claiming he had run away.
He was never heard from again.</p>
      <p>You attend a small funeral for the child a week later.
It is a sad occasion, but you are happy to know that
the boy's spirit has at last found peace.</p>
      <p>THE END</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ghost_run" style="display:none">
      <p>In terror, you run for the front door with the child's
voice crying out behind you. You make it outside and run
across the front yard, finally looking over your shoulder
as you reach the sidewalk. You see the child standing in
the doorway with a ghostly arm outstretched. No farther
would he follow, it seems. Except in dreams. He still
haunts you in your dreams.</p>
      <p>THE END</p>
